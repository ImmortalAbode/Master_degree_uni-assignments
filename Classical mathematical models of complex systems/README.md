  Lab1: 
  + Using two other libraries, coded by good people, by below links:
    - https://github.com/QtExcel/QXlsx - for using Excel in Qt;
    - https://www.qcustomplot.com/index.php/download - for drawing graphs in Qt.
  + Regression analysis of the growth of the euro to ruble exchange rate.
  
  Lab2-3:
  + ParametrOfCompl - second lab for synthetic data (UAV on-board system and integration system error);
  + BLAFlightSimulation - third lab for synthetic and experimental data (UAV on-board system and integration system error + flight trajectory graphs (latitude and longitude))
 
  Lab 4:
  + LifeGameCellularAutomata - classical Conway's Game of Life (Cellular automaton);
  + LifeGameByEvents - Conway's Game of Life based on discrete events (Cellular automaton).
  
  * The PyGame library is used for visualization and process control. It significantly speeds up rendering and is more user-friendly ;D.
  * This program also includes mechanisms for recording and saving visualization frames in .png format. Any action is a frame, and there can be many of them.
  
  *P.S. If you want to enjoy the simplest cellular automaton mechanism, use the first program, as the second is more scientific in nature.*
